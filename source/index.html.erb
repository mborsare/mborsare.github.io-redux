      This is what I do at work
    </h2>
    <p>
      I create and implement strong, memorable products. I mentor young
      designers. I ask why a whole bunch. I create and improve design systems. I
      strike a balance between excellent visual design and intuitive user
      experience.

      This is what I do outside of work
    </h2>
    <p>
      I run. I read books. I watch college football (Roll Tide). I play
      peek-a-boo with my new daughter Cora. And oh so many, many, other things.
